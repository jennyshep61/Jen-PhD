# Jen-PhD
All my PhD work involving analysis of time series (MODIS) satellite data searching for signals of resilience and critical slowing down (may be the same thing?) in (UK) forests of relevance to Europe and beyond.
Coding work is being done in Python using Jupyter Lab 
The raw NDVI data is extracted from Google Earth Engine 
Further analysis is done using a smoothing/declouding algorithm called SWEEP.
